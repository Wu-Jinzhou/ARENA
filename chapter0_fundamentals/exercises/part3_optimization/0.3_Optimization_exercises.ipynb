    "In today's exercises, we will explore various optimization algorithms and their roles in training deep learning models. We will delve into the inner workings of different optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RMSprop, and Adam, and learn how to implement them using code. Additionally, we will discuss the concept of loss landscapes and their significance in visualizing the challenges faced during the optimization process. By the end of this set of exercises, you will have a solid understanding of optimization algorithms and their impact on model performance. We'll also take a look at Weights and Biases, a tool that can be used to track and visualize the training process, and test different values of hyperparameters to find the most effective ones.\n",

    "Tomorrow, we'll look in detail about how the backpropagation algorithm works. But for now, let's take it as read that calling `loss.backward()` on a scalar `loss` will result in the computation of the gradients $\\frac{\\partial loss}{\\partial w}$ for every parameter `w` in the model, and store these values in `w.grad`. How do we use these gradients to update our parameters in a way which decreases loss?"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "A loss function can be any differentiable function such that we prefer a lower value. To apply gradient descent, we start by initializing the parameters to random values (the details of this are subtle), and then repeatedly compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the model parameters. It [can be proven](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/DirectionalDeriv.aspx) that for an infinitesimal step, moving in the direction of the gradient would increase the loss by the largest amount out of all possible directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We actually want to decrease the loss, so we subtract the gradient to go in the opposite direction. Taking infinitesimal steps is no good, so we pick some learning rate $\\lambda$ (also called the step size) and scale our step by that amount to obtain the update rule for gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_t \\leftarrow \\theta_{t-1} - \\lambda \\nabla L(\\theta_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that an infinitesimal step will decrease the loss, but a finite step will only do so if the loss function is linear enough in the neighbourhood of the current parameters. If the loss function is too curved, we might actually increase our loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest advantage of this algorithm is that for N bytes of parameters, you only need N additional bytes of memory to store the gradients, which are of the same shape as the parameters. GPU memory is very limited, so this is an extremely relevant consideration. The amount of computation needed is also minimal: one multiply and one add per parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest disadvantage is that we're completely ignoring the curvature of the loss function, not captured by the gradient consisting of partial derivatives. Intuitively, we can take a larger step if the loss function is flat in some direction or a smaller step if it is very curved. Generally, you could represent this by some matrix P that pre-multiplies the gradients to rescale them to account for the curvature. $P$ is called a preconditioner, and gradient descent is equivalent to approximating $P$ by an identity matrix, which is a very bad approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most competing optimizers can be interpreted as trying to do something more sensible for $P$, subject to the constraint that GPU memory is at a premium. In particular, constructing $P$ explicitly is infeasible, since it's an $N \\times N$ matrix and N can be hundreds of billions. One idea is to use a diagonal $P$, which only requires N additional memory. An example of a more sophisticated scheme is [Shampoo](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09568.pdf)."

    "## Stochastic Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms gradient descent and SGD are used loosely in deep learning. To be technical, there are three variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss over the entire dataset. This requires too much computation unless the dataset is small, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n",
    "- Stochastic gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a randomly selected example. Any particular loss may be completely in the wrong direction of the loss on the entire dataset, but in expectation it's in the right direction. This has some nice properties but doesn't parallelize well, so it is rarely used in deep learning.\n",
    "- Mini-batch gradient descent - the loss function is the loss on a batch of examples of size `batch_size`. This is the standard in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `torch.optim.SGD` can be used for any of these by varying the number of examples passed in. We will be using only mini-batch gradient descent in this course."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to choosing a learning rate or learning rate schedule, we need to choose the batch size or batch size schedule as well. Intuitively, using a larger batch means that the estimate of the gradient is closer to that of the true gradient over the entire dataset, but this requires more compute. Each element of the batch can be computed in parallel so with sufficient compute, one can increase the batch size without increasing wall-clock time. For small-scale experiments, a good heuristic is thus \"fill up all of your GPU memory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At a larger scale, we would expect diminishing returns of increasing the batch size, but empirically it's worse than that - a batch size that is too large generalizes more poorly in many scenarios. The intuition that a closer approximation to the true gradient is always better is therefore incorrect. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf) for one discussion of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a batch size schedule, most commonly you'll see batch sizes increase over the course of training. The intuition is that a rough estimate of the proper direction is good enough early in training, but later in training it's important to preserve our progress and not \"bounce around\" too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will commonly see batch sizes that are a multiple of 32. One motivation for this is that when using CUDA, threads are grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads which execute the same instructions in parallel. So a batch size of 64 would allow two warps to be fully utilized, whereas a size of 65 would require waiting for a third warp to finish. As batch sizes become larger, this wastage becomes less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Powers of two are also common - the idea here is that work can be recursively divided up among different GPUs or within a GPU. For example, a matrix multiplication can be expressed by recursively dividing each matrix into four equal blocks and performing eight smaller matrix multiplications between the blocks.\n",

    "### Weight Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight decay means that on each iteration, in addition to a regular step, we also shrink each parameter very slightly towards 0 by multiplying a scaling factor close to 1, e.g. 0.9999. Empirically, this seems to help but there are no proofs that apply to deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of linear regression, weight decay is mathematically equivalent to having a prior that each parameter is Gaussian distributed - in other words it's very unlikely that the true parameter values are very positive or very negative. This is an example of \"**inductive bias**\" - we make an assumption that helps us in the case where it's justified, and hurts us in the case where it's not justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a `Linear` layer, it's common practice to apply weight decay only to the weight and not the bias. It's also common to not apply weight decay to the parameters of a batch normalization layer. Again, there is empirical evidence (such as [Jai et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf)) and there are heuristic arguments to justify these choices, but no rigorous proofs. Note that PyTorch will implement weight decay on the weights *and* biases of linear layers by default - see the bonus exercises tomorrow for more on this."

In words, pathological curvatures typically have a steep gradient in one direction with an optimum at the center, while in a second direction we have a slower gradient towards a (global) optimum. Let’s first create an example surface of this and visualize it.

In other words, this should look just like your optimization loops in previous days' material, except rather than passing in `model.parameters()` to your optimizer, you pass in `(xy,)` (because it needs to be an iterable of parameters, not just a single parameter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, your update steps `optimizer.step()` will automatically change the values of `xy` inplace - this means that you shouldn't store past values like `xy_list.append(xy)` because then past elements of that list will be modified when `xy` is updated. Instead, you should use something like `xy_list.append(xy.detach().clone())` to make sure you're returning a copy of the tensor, which won't continue to be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also provided you with a function `plot_fn_with_points`, which plots a function as well as a list of points produced by functions like the one above. The code below starts from `(2.5, 2.5)` and adds the resulting trajectory of `(x, y)` coordinates to the contour plot. Does it find the minimum? Play with the learning rate and momentum a bit and see how close you can get within 100 iterations."

    "### RMSProp (and adaptive methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "From SGD, we'll move onto discussing **adaptive gradient descent methods**. These are methods which automatically adjust the learning rate of each parameter during training, based on the size of gradients at previous steps. In a sense this is similar to how momentum operates in SGD, but we don't tend to describe SGD plus momentum as an adaptive method. When discussing momentum, we usually think of the analogy of a ball rolling down a hill, and the ball's velocity accelerates until it reaches some terminal velocity. The momentum parameter $\\mu$ controls the terminal velocity: as $\\mu \\to 1$ the terminal velocity gets very high, which also means it can take a long time to adjust its speed when it enters new territory. In contrast, adaptive methods are better thought of as deliberate, conscious updates to the learning rate of parameters based on past values. They allow us to speed up when we need to, but without sacrificing our ability to adapt quickly when we enter new regimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first adaptive method we'll look at is **RMSprop**. This is actually the second main adaptive method that was proposed in the optimization literature, after AdaGrad (however the problem with AdaGrad is that it decays the learning rates too quickly - this is the problem that RMSprop solves). RMSprop is similar to SGD, with an added dynamic: **the size of parameter steps are scaled according to the variance of past gradients**, with higher variance leading to smaller steps. Intuitively, if you're in a very monotonic region of the loss landscape then you want to take larger steps (since you know where you're going and you just want to get there quickly), whereas if you're in a very noisy region and possibly oscillating around minima then you want to take smaller steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final note - when we're using non-adaptive methods like SGD we tend to have an inverse relationship between the learning rate and the batch size. Broadly speaking, this is because a larger batch size means our gradients will have smaller variance, and so we can safely use a larger learning rate. This generally isn't necessary for adaptive methods since the learning rates will be adjusted automatically during training based on the variance of our gradients - we don't need to manually scale them ourselves. Most commonly during optimization, we'll start with the default hyperparameters for whatever adaptive optimizer we're using, and then adjust from there."

These combine the benefits of RMSprop and SGD with momentum: they have the same variance-based scaling as RMSprop, but they also have an update rule based on the first moment of gradients as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's an important clarification to make here - the first order adjustment of Adam is sometimes called momentum as a shorthand, but there's an important sense in which it isn't. The key difference is that SGD's momentum causes acceleration until we hit terminal velocity, which could be very large for $\\mu \\approx 1$. In contrast, Adam's momentum is an exponentially weighted moving average - the parameter $\\beta_1$ controls how quickly it adjusts (with a value closer to 1 meaning it adjust to newer values more slowly), but it doesn't change the terminal velocity in any sense. Mathematically, the difference between these two is minimal (all you'd need to do is take Adam's update rule $m_t \\leftarrow \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1-\\beta_1) g_t$ and change it to $m_t \\leftarrow \\beta_1 m_{t-1} + g_t$ for it to have the same qualitative behaviour as SGD), but this extra factor makes a lot of difference!"

For another, momentum causes RMSprop step sizes to increase in an unstable way, which is why it will overshoot the minima and get stuck on the other side without careful hyperparameter tuning.

    "Next, Rosenbrock's banana. This function has a global minimum at `(1, 1)` inside a long, narrow, parabolic-shaped valley. Basic gradient descent often zigzags back and forth along the valley, making very slow progress. Momentum is absolutely essential to perform well in this task. This is a rare case where SGD plus momentum does converge faster than Adam because the higher terminal velocity enables larger step sizes plus the extreme slope of the loss landscape prevents the kind of instability that usually hinders SGD. However, some caveats: SGD requires a very small step size to prevent unstable oscillations (given how steep the valley is), whereas Adam is much more stable. Furthermore, if we extend the number of iterations, we see that Adam does also converge, and it does so with fewer oscillations than SGD (it stays within the parabolic valley).\n",

Because training networks from scratch is very computationally expensive, this is a common practice in ML.\n",

We call this feature extraction because the earlier layers of the model have already learned to identify important features of the data (and these features are also relevant for the new task), so all that we have to do is train a few final layers in the model to extract these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Terminology note - sometimes feature extraction and finetuning are defined differently, with finetuning referring to the training of all the weights in a pretrained model (usually with a small or decaying learning rate), and feature extraction referring to the freezing of some layers and training of others. To avoid confusion here, we'll use the term \"feature extraction\" rather than \"finetuning\".*\n",

We've used the `get_resnet_for_feature_extraction` function to do this (the code for this is given to you below so you won't have to write it yourself). This function creates a version of the `ResNet34` model, loads in weights from the PyTorch ResNet34 implementation, freezes all layers, and replaces the final linear layer with an unfrozen randomly initialized linear layer with a certain number of output features (in our case 10 because we're doing feature extraction on CIFAR10 - see next section)."

Don't peek at what other people online have done for CIFAR10 (it's a common benchmark), because the point is to develop your own process by which you can figure out how to improve your model. Just reading the results of someone else would prevent you from learning how to get the answers. To get an idea of what's possible: using one V100 and a modified ResNet, one entry in the DAWNBench competition was able to achieve 94% test accuracy in 24 epochs and 76 seconds. 94% is approximately [human level performance](http://karpathy.github.io/2011/04/27/manually-classifying-cifar10/).\n",

    "First, let's build on the training function we used yesterday. Previously, we just used a single `train` function which took a dataclass as argument. But this resulted in a very long function with many nested loops and some repeated code. Instead, we'll write our code in the form of a `ResNetFinetuner` class with multiple methods, each one being responsible for a single part of the training process. This will make our code more modular, and easier to read and debug. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've given you the `ResNetFinetuner` class below, as well as a dataclass which contains all the hyperparameters we'll use (again this helps us keep everything organized). You should read this and make sure you understand the role of each method. A brief summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pre_training_setup` defines the model, optimizer, dataset, and objects for logging data. Note that it's not good practice to have this logic run in `__init__`, because it's something we only need to do just before actually training (this structural flexibility will prove useful later, when we introduce weights & biases).\n",
    "* `training_step` does a single gradient update step on a single batch of data, and logs & returns the loss.\n",
    "* `evaluate` method computes the total accuracy of the model over the validation set, and logs & returns this accuracy. Note use of the `torch.inference_mode()` decorator, which stops gradients propagating (this is equivalent to using it as a context manager).\n",
    "* `train` combines this all: it performs the pre-training setup, then alternates between training & evaluation for some number of epochs. Note that `model.train()` and `model.eval()` are called before these stages respectively - for why we have to do this, see yesterday's discussion of BatchNorm."

    "Weights and Biases is a cloud service that allows you to log data from experiments. Your logged data is shown in graphs during training, and you can easily compare logs across different runs. It also allows you to run **sweeps**, where you can specifiy a distribution over hyperparameters and then start a sequence of test runs which use hyperparameters sampled from this distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run any of the code below, you should visit the [Weights and Biases homepage](https://wandb.ai/home), and create your own account.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be able to keep the same structure of training loop when using weights and biases, we'll just have to add a few functions. The key functions to know are:"

    "#### `wandb.init`\n",
    "\n",
    "This initialises a training run. It should be called once, at the start of your training loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few important arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `project` - the name of the project where you're sending the new run. For example, this could be `'day3-resnet'` for us. You can have many different runs in each project.\n",
    "* `name` - a display name for this run. By default, if this isn't supplied, wandb generates a random 2-word name for you (e.g. `gentle-sunflower-42`).\n",
    "* `config` - a dictionary containing hyperparameters for this run. If you pass this dictionary, then you can compare different runs' hyperparameters & results in a single table. Alternatively, you can pass a dataclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `wandb.watch`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function tells wandb to watch a model - this means that it will log the gradients and parameters of the model during training. We'll call this function once, after we've created our model. The 3 most important arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `models` - a module or list of modules (e.g. in our case we might just want to log the weights of the final linear layer, because the others aren't being trained)\n",
    "* `log` - determines what gets tracked, possible values are `'gradients'` (default), `'parameters'` or `'all'`\n",
    "* `log_freq` - the number of batches between each logging step (default is 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we log parameters and gradients? Mainly this is [helpful for debugging](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/articles/reports/Debugging-Neural-Networks-with-PyTorch-and-W-B-Using-Gradients-and-Visualizations--Vmlldzo1NDQxNTA5), because it helps us identify problems like exploding or vanishing gradients, dead ReLUs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `wandb.log`\n",
    "\n",
    "For logging metrics to the wandb dashboard. This is used as `wandb.log(data, step)`, where `step` is an integer (the x-axis on your metric plots) and `data` is a dictionary of metrics (i.e. the keys are metric names, and the values are metric values).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This function should be called at the end of your training loop. It finishes the run, and saves the results to the cloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a run terminates early (either because of an error or because you manually terminated it), remember to still run `wandb.finish()` - it will speed things up when you start a new run (otherwise you have to wait for the previous run to be terminated & uploaded)."

    "You should now take the training loop from above (i.e. the `ResNetTrainer` class) and rewrite it to use the four `wandb` functions above (in place of the `logged_variables` dictionary, which you can now remove). This will require:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initializing your run\n",
    "    - Your new `pre_training_setup` method should call `wandb.watch` and `wandb.init` as well as all the stuff it previously did\n",
    "    - For `wandb.init`, you can use the project & name arguments from your new dataclass (see below)\n",
    "    - For `wandb.watch`, be careful of the `log_freq` value - you want to make sure you're logging more than once per epoch\n",
    "- Logging variables to wandb during your run\n",
    "    - i.e. replace updating of `self.logged_variables` with calls to `wandb.log`\n",
    "    - We recommend tracking `self.examples_seen` and passing this as the `step` argument to your logging calls, this way it's easier to compare across different runs with e.g. different batch sizes (more on this later)\n",
    "- Finishing the run\n",
    "    - i.e. calling `wandb.finish` at the end of your training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all you need to do to get wandb working, so the vast majority of the code you write below will be copied and pasted from the previous `ResNetFinetuner` class. We've given you a template for this below, along with a new dataclass. Both the dataclass and the trainer class use inheritance to remove code duplication (e.g. because we don't need to rewrite our `__init__` method, it'll be the same as for `ResNetFinetuner`).\n",
    "\n",

    "## Some training heuristics\n",
    "\n",
    "One important skill which every aspiring ML researcher should develop is the ability to play around with hyperparameters and improve a model's training. At times this is more of an art than a science, because frequently rules and heuristics which work most of the time will break down in certain special cases. For example, a common heuristic for number of workers in a `DataLoader` is to set them to be 4 times the number of GPUs you have available (see later sections on distributed computing for more on this). However, setting these values too high can lead to issues where your CPU is bottlenecked by the workers and your epochs take a long time to start - it took me a long time to realize this was happening when I was initially writing these exercises!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sweeping over hyperparameters (which we'll cover shortly) can help remove some of the difficulty here, because you can use sweep methods that guide you towards an optimal set of hyperparameter choices rather than having to manually pick your own. However, here are a few heuristics that you might find useful in a variety of situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Setting batch size**\n",
    "    - Generally you should aim to **saturate your GPU** with data - this means choosing a batch size that's as large as possible without causing memory errors\n",
    "        - You should generally aim for over 70% utilization of your GPU\n",
    "    - Note, this means you should generally try for a larger batch size in your testloader than your trainloader (because evaluation is done without gradients, and so a smaller memory constraint)\n",
    "        - A good starting point is 4x the size, but this will vary between models\n",
    "- **Choosing a learning rate**\n",
    "    - Inspecting loss curves can be a good way of evaluating our learning rate\n",
    "        - If loss is decreasing very slowly & monotonically then this is a sign you should increase the learning rate, whereas very large loss spikes are a sign that you should decrease it\n",
    "    - A common strategy is **warmup**, i.e. having a smaller learning rate for a short period of time at the start of training - we'll do this a lot in later material\n",
    "    - [Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/nn-learning-rate/) has a good blog post on learning rates\n",
    "- **Balancing learning rate and batch size**\n",
    "    - For standard optimizers like `SGD`, it's a good idea to scale the learning rate inversely to the batch size - this way the variance of each parameter step remains the same\n",
    "    - However for **adaptive optimizers** such as `Adam` (where the size of parameter updates automatically adjusts based on the first and second moments of our gradients), this isn't as necessary\n",
    "        - This is why we generally start with default parameters for Adam, and then adjust from there\n",
    "- **Misc. advice**\n",
    "    - If you're training a larger model, it's sometimes a good idea to start with a smaller version of that same model. Good hyperparameters tend to transfer if the architecture & data is the same; the main difference is the larger model may require more regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    - Bad hyperparameters are usually clearly worse by the end of the first 1-2 epochs. You can manually abort runs that don't look promising (or do it automatically - see discussion of Hyperband in wandb sweeps at the end of this section)\n",
    "    - Overfitting at the start is better than underfitting, because it means your model is capable of learning and has enough capacity"

    "## Hyperparameter search\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to search for good hyperparameters is to choose a set of values for each hyperparameter, and then search all combinations of those specific values. This is called **grid search**. The values don't need to be evenly spaced and you can incorporate any knowledge you have about plausible values from similar problems to choose the set of values. Searching the product of sets takes exponential time, so is really only feasible if there are a small number of hyperparameters. I would recommend forgetting about grid search if you have more than 3 hyperparameters, which in deep learning is \"always\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A much better idea is for each hyperparameter, decide on a sampling distribution and then on each trial just sample a random value from that distribution. This is called **random search** and back in 2012, you could get a [publication](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/bergstra12a/bergstra12a.pdf) for this. The diagram below shows the main reason that random search outperforms grid search. Empirically, some hyperparameters matter more than others, and random search benefits from having tried more distinct values in the important dimensions, increasing the chances of finding a \"peak\" between the grid points.\n",

We do this by defining a `sweep_config` dict which tells us how our hyperparameters will be randomly sampled, then we write a `train` function which takes no arguments and launches a training run with our modified hyperparameters.

    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for a sweep config looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sweep_config = dict(\n",
    "    method = method, # can be \"grid\", \"random\" or \"bayes\"\n",
    "    metric = dict(\n",
    "        name = metric_name, # name of the metric you're optimising (should be a numeric type logged in `wandb.log`)\n",
    "        goal = goal, # either \"maximize\" or \"minimize\"\n",
    "    )),\n",

    "    ),\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `method` argument determines how we perform search: `grid` is over all combinations, `random` independently samples each hyperparameter, and `bayes` uses Bayesian optimization to sample hyperparameters. The `metric` dict determines what logged variable we're optimizing, and in what direction. Lastly, `parameters` is a list of parameters we're varying, with each dictionary describing how we want that parameter to be sampled. Possible ways to specify distributions include:\n",

    "parameters = dict(\n",

    "    param_4 = dict(min = ..., max = ..., distribution = \"log_uniform_values\"), # use log-uniform distribution instead\n",

    "\n",
    "Distributed training is a model training paradigm that involves spreading training workload across multiple worker nodes, therefore significantly improving the speed of training and model accuracy. While distributed training can be used for any type of ML model training, it is most beneficial to use it for large models and compute demanding tasks as deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main families of distributed training methods: **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**. In data parallelism, we split batches of data across different processes, run forward & backward passes on each separately, and accumulate the gradients to update the model parameters. In model parallelism, the model is segmented into different parts that can run concurrently in different nodes, and each one runs on the same data. Model parallelism further splits into horizontal and vertical parallelism depending on whether we're splitting the model up into sequential or parallel parts. Most often horizontal parallelism is called **tensor parallelism** (because it involves splitting up the weights in a single layer across multiple GPUs, into what we commonly call **sharded weights**), and vertical parallelism is called **pipeline parallelism**.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/info-arena/ARENA_img/main/misc/parallelism.png\" width=\"1100\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Data & model parallelism are both widely used, and can be more or less appropriate in different circumstances (e.g. some kind of model parallelism is necessary when your model is too large to fit on a single GPU). However it is possible to create hybrid forms of parallelism by combining these; this is especially common when training large models like current SOTA LLMs. In these exercises, we'll focus on just data parallelism, although we'll suggest a few bonus exercises that explore model parallelism."

    "The exercises below will take you through **data parallelism**. You'll start by learning how to use the basic send and receive functions in PyTorch's distributed training module `torch.distributed` to transfer tensors between different processes (and different GPUs). Note that **you'll need multiple GPUs for these exercises** - we've included instructions in a dropdown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Getting multiple GPUs</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions for booting up a machine from vastai can already be found on the Streamlit homepage (i.e. navigate to \"Home\" on the sidebar, then to the section \"Virtual Machines\"). The only extra thing you'll need to do here is filter for an appropriate machine type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend filtering for \"Disk Space To Allocate\" (i.e. the primary slider on the top of the filter menu) of at least 40GB, not for the model (which is actually quite small) but for installing the ARENA dependencies. You should also filter for number of GPUs: we recommend 4x or 8x. You can do this using the options menu at the very top of the list of machines. Lastly, we recommend filtering for a decent PCIE Bandwidth (e.g. at least 20GB/s) - this is important for efficient gradient sychronization between GPUs. We're training a small model today: approx 22m parameters, which translates to ~88MB total size of weights, and so we'll transfer 88MB of data between GPUs per process (since we're transferring the model's gradients, which have the same size as the weights). We don't want this to be a bottleneck, which is why we should filter for this bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've filtered for this, we recommend picking an RTX 3090 or 4090 machine. These won't be as powerful as an A100, but the purpose today is more to illustrate the basic ideas behind distributed training than to push your model training to its limits. Note that if you were using an A100 then you should filter for a high NVLink Bandwidth rather than PCIE (since A100s use NVLink instead of PCIE).\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done this, you'll use those 2 primitive point-to-point functions to build up some more advanced functions: `broadcast` (which gets a tensor from one process to all others), `gather` (which gathers all tensors from different devices to a single device) and `all_reduce` (which combines both `broadcast` and `gather` to make aggregate tensor values across all processes). These functions (`all_reduce` in particular) are key parts of how distributed computing works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you'll learn how to use these functions to build a distributed training loop, which will be adapted from the `ResNetTrainer` code from your previous exercises. We also explain how you can use `DistributedDataParallel` to abstract away these low-level operations, which you might find useful later on (although you will benefit from building these components up from scratch, and understanding how they work under the hood)."

    "The code below is a simplified example that demonstrates distributed communication between multiple processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the highest level, `mp.spawn()` launches multiple worker processes, each with a unique rank. For each worker, we create a new Python interpreter (called a \"child process\") which will execute the function passed to `mp.spawn` (which in this case is `send_receive`). The function has to have the type signature `fn(rank, *args)` where `args` is the tuple we pass into `mp.spawn()`. The total number of processes is determined by `world_size`. Note that this isn't the same as the number of GPUs - in fact, in the code below we've not moved any of our data to GPUs, we're just using the distributed API to sync data across multiple processes. We'll introduce GPUs in the code below this!\n",
    "\n",
    "We require the environment variables `MASTER_ADDR` and `MASTER_PORT` to be set before launching & communicating between processes. The former specifies the IP address or hostname of the machine that will act as the central coordinator (the \"master\" node) for setting up and managing the distributed environment, while the latter specifies the port number that the master node will use for communication. In our case we're running all our processes from a single node, so all we need is for this to be an unused port on our machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, breaking down the `send_receive` function line by line:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dist.init_process_group` initializes each process with a common address and port, and a communication backend. It also gives each process a unique rank, so they know who is sending & receiving data.\n",
    "- If the function is being run by rank 0, then we create a tensor of zeros and send it using `dist.send`.\n",
    "- If the function is being run by rank 1, then we create a tensor of ones and wait to receive a tensor from rank 0 using `dist.recv`. This will overwrite the data in the original tensor that we created, i.e. so we're just left with a tensor of zeros.\n",
    "- `dist.destroy_process_group()` is called at the end of the function to destroy the process group and release resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `dist.send` and `dist.recv` are the basic primitives for point-to-point communication between processes (we'll look at the primitives for collective communication later on). Each `recv` for a given source process `src` will wait until it receives a `send` from that source to continue, and likewise each `send` to a given destination process `dst` will wait until it receives a `recv` from that process to continue. We call these **blocking operations** (later on we'll look at non-blocking operations)."

Your job is just to make the 4 adjustments described above. We recommend not using inheritance for this, because there are lots of minor modifications you'll need to make to the previous code and so you won't be reducing code duplication by very much. \n",

    "- If your code is running slowly, we recommend you also `wandb.log` the duration of each stage of the training step from the rank 0 process (fwd pass, bwd pass, and `all_reduce` for parameter syncing), as well as logging the duration of the training & evaluation phases across the epoch. These kinds of logs are generally very helpful for debugging slow code.\n",
    "- Since running this code won't directly return your model as output, it's good practice to save your model at the end of training using `torch.save`.\n",
    "- We recommend you increment `examples_seen` by the total number of examples across processes, i.e. `len(input) * world_size`. This will help when you're comparing across different runs with different world sizes (it's convenient for them to have a consistent x-axis)."

It chooses a single process as the source process to receive then send out all data, and so this process risks becoming a bottleneck. One of the most popular alternatives is **ring all-reduce**. Broadly speaking, ring-based algorithms work by sending data in a cyclic pattern (i.e. worker `n` sends it to worker `n+1 % N` where `N` is the total number of workers). After each sending round, we perform a reduction operation to the data that was just sent.

    "These bonus exercises are taken directly from Jacob Hilton's [online deep learning curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/blob/master/2-Scaling-Laws.md) (which is what the original version of the ARENA course was based on).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you can start by reading the [Chinchilla paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556). This is a correction to the original scaling laws paper: parameter count scales linearly with token budget for compute-optimal models, not ~quadratically. The difference comes from using a separately-tuned learning rate schedule for each token budget, rather than using a single training run to measure performance for every token budget. This highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning for measuring scaling law exponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't have to read the entire paper, just skim the graphs. Don't worry if they don't all make sense yet (it will be more illuminating when we study LLMs next week). Note that, although it specifically applies to language models, the key underlying ideas of tradeoffs between optimal dataset size and model size are generally applicable.\n",

    "### Suggested exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform your own study of scaling laws for MNIST.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a script to train a small CNN on MNIST, or find one you have written previously.\n",
    "- Training for a single epoch only, vary the model size and dataset size. For the model size, multiply the width by powers of sqrt(2) (rounding if necessary - the idea is to vary the amount of compute used per forward pass by powers of 2). For the dataset size, multiply the fraction of the full dataset used by powers of 2 (i.e. 1, 1/2, 1/4, ...). To reduce noise, use a few random seeds and always use the full validation set.\n",
    "- The learning rate will need to vary with model size. Either tune it carefully for each model size, or use the rule of thumb that for Adam, the learning rate should be proportional to the initialization scale, i.e. `1/sqrt(fan_in)` for the standard Kaiming He initialization (which is what PyTorch generally uses by default).\n",
    "    - Note - `fan_in` refers to the variable $N_{in}$, which is `in_features` for a linear layer, and `in_channels * kernel_size * kernel_size` for a convolutional layer - in other words, the number of input parameters/activations we take a sumproduct over to get each output activation.\n",
    "- Plot the amount of compute used (on a log scale) against validation loss. The compute-efficient frontier should follow an approximate power law (straight line on a log scale).\n",
    "How does validation accuracy behave?\n",
    "- Study how the compute-efficient model size varies with compute. This should also follow an approximate power law. Try to estimate its exponent.\n",
    "- Repeat your entire experiment with 20% [dropout](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Dropout.html) to see how this affects the scaling exponents."
